    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Inspired by a shrimp po' boy with crab mayo seen on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives," I decided to create an extra
        spicy recipe—firecracker shrimp roll with crab aioli—and give it a July Fourth-friendly name. The result is an
        explosively flavored combination of hot, crunchy shrimp and cold crabby mayo—it was one of the best things I've
        had in a long time, and that's after eating it barely warm. For best results, enjoy this just as soon as it's
        safe to eat, in all its crunchy glory.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p><em>This is intended for 6 servings</em></p>

    </p>

    <p>
    <h4>Buttermilk Soak:</h4>

        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h4>Breading:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>⅓ cup cornmeal</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

        <li>6 soft sandwich rolls</li>

        <li>2 cups thinly sliced romaine lettuce</li>

        <li>canola oil for frying</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine mayonnaise, crabmeat, tarragon, garlic, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 pinch cayenne
            pepper in a bowl; season with salt and stir to combine. Refrigerate aioli until ready to use.</li>

        <li>Remove tails from shrimp; refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Whisk buttermilk, hot sauce, 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, ground chipotle, and black
            pepper together in a bowl; set aside. Combine flour, cornmeal, paprika, and 2 teaspoons kosher salt in a
            shallow dish; set aside.</li>

        <li>Slice sandwich rolls partway; split open. Scoop out some bread from tops. Toast in the preheated oven until
            crisp, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Soak shrimp in buttermilk mixture for about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Spread crab aioli generously over both sides of
            each roll; top with sliced lettuce. Toss shrimp in cornmeal mixture to coat; shake off excess.</li>

        <li>Lower shrimp carefully into the hot oil in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side.
            Drain on a paper towel-lined plate; immediately transfer shrimp to rolls. Sprinkle cayenne pepper on top.
            Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
    </ol>
