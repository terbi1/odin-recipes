    <h1>Banana Bread Pancakes</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>If you're a <em>fan</em> of our banana bread, then you're gonna <strong>LOVE</strong> this, since it's based on that recipe. As easy as that is to make, these are <em>even easier</em>. I really think that this threads the needle between something that has the flavor of banana bread, but that is very close to the texture of a classic pancake. Top with butter and banana slices and serve with warm maple syrup.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <p><em>This is intended for 3 servings</em></p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 large ripe banana</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>½ cup finely chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a small bowl with a whisk. Reserve until needed.</li>
            <li>Place banana in a mixing bowl and mash into a smooth paste with a potato masher. Add egg and sugar and whisk thoroughly until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add milk, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup melted butter, walnuts, and flour mixture. Whisk until just combined.</li>
            <li>Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large, nonstick pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, transfer in about 1/3 cup of the batter per pancake. Reduce heat to medium and cook until edges start to look dry and small air bubbles pop up through the surface, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
